For \"self\" to be non-NULL, the thread must be attached to the VM already, and none of this would be executing.\n\nargs-\u003egroup must be a global reference, which means the VM doesn\u0027t need a JNIEnv* to decode it.  Change the first arg from \"self-\u003ejniEnv\" to \"NULL\".\n\nIt\u0027d probably be wise to note this situation in the header comment for dvmDecodeIndirectRef(), to ensure that somebody doesn\u0027t try to use \"env\" in the kIndirectKindGlobal case.",
