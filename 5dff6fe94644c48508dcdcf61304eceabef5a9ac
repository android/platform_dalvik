      "message": "Hmm, no TARGET_ARCH_VARIANT set for sim-eng.\n\nTwo thoughts:\n\n(1) Is there value in having variant-specific versions of Call386ABI.S?  On the one hand it\u0027s pretty straightforward code, on the other I don\u0027t know if ABI variations are expected.\n\n(2) Might make more sense to patch this up earlier, e.g. in Android.mk:\n\nifeq ($(TARGET_ARCH_VARIANT),)\n    TARGET_ARCH_VARIANT :\u003d $(TARGET_ARCH)\nendif\n\n(Tried it, seems to work.  Another route would be to fail noisily if it\u0027s not set, and then add an entry for sim-eng somewhere.  Will solicit input.)",
