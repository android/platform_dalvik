This causes issues with our bazel build that crawls entire workspace and looks for BUILD files (there is currently no support to exclude some dirs). We run tests on case-insensitive file systems (Mac and Win), and this breaks us. 135-invoke-custom already adds file with the same name, so it would be great to rename that one as well.",
