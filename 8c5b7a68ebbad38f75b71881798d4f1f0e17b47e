      "message": "this is extremely nit picking and perhaps moot since dalvik dexdump should really go away, but using this kind of destructors, although nowadays good programming practice, is a bit out of place in the rest of this file, where we allocate/free everything explicitly.\n\nsince you only have one stack use at L911, you might as well move the freeing there",

      "message": "This raises another question: the old dexdump could be used to dump true \"odex\" files from the past (quickened). This change will display new Art functionality in those cases? Do we care (answer is probably, no, or even better, why is dexdump2 not the standard yet, Aart! :-)",
