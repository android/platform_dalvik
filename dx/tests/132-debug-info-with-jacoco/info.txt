This is a non-regression test that checks that a class file with full debug
info instrumented by Jacoco >= 0.7.5 does not produce an infinite loop in
LocalVariableExtractor anymore.

The class file instrumented by Jacoco can be regenerated from the source file
using "ant". You also need the "jacoco-ant" jar which can be built from
"external/jacoco/org.jacoco.ant" with maven.
