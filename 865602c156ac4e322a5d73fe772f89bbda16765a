      "message": "It looks like this CL is just moving the creation of the .class files (via jasmin or $JAVAC) from \"run\" to \"build\", and is also adding prebuilt .class files.\n\nAren\u0027t those prebuilt .class files going to be overwritten and ignored by jasmin / $JAVAC at \"build\" time? I can\u0027t find where the existing .class files are treated as \"golden input\" or wh the jasmin / $JAVAC invocations are still present in the \"build\" files. Are those \"build\" steps not run by the test runner script the way they are for the tests below art/test? \n\nWhat am I missing / misunderstanding?",

      "message": "This change is trying to move to using golden reference files for dx inputs. It attempts to be consistent in this end. The CL is pre-building as much as possible. The sequential time for running the tests is decreased by 33%. The repo space overhead is not really a concern for the majority of tests here. For the ones that generate masses of class files, these are not checked in. With the exception of the four awkward tests, it\u0027s consistent in the approach.\n\nThese tests pre-date the ART tests and did not resemble those tests before this CL and are not intended to now. The DX tests are barely sufficient as a whole, but better than no tests. The goal is to keep them running rather than aspiring to new perfection for a tool that is on life support.",
