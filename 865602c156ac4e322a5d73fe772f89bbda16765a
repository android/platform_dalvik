      "message": "It looks like this CL is just moving the creation of the .class files (via jasmin or $JAVAC) from \"run\" to \"build\", and is also adding prebuilt .class files.\n\nAren\u0027t those prebuilt .class files going to be overwritten and ignored by jasmin / $JAVAC at \"build\" time? I can\u0027t find where the existing .class files are treated as \"golden input\" or wh the jasmin / $JAVAC invocations are still present in the \"build\" files. Are those \"build\" steps not run by the test runner script the way they are for the tests below art/test? \n\nWhat am I missing / misunderstanding?",
